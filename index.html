        <!-- The <span> element -->
            <p>this is an inline span <span style="border: 1px solid black;">Hello World</span> element inside a paragraph.</p>
            <p>The SPAN element is an inline element, and will not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.</p>
        <!-- The <div> element -->
        <div style="border: 1px solid black;">Hello World!</div>
        <p>The DIV element is a block element, and will always start on a new line and take up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</p>
